            <p>Red Mirch is a fictional restaurant created solely for the purpose of showcasing my HTML and CSS skills. The name Red Mirch and the content provided, including the dishes, restaurant story, and imagery, are entirely fabricated and do not represent any real business or establishment. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end web development, specifically in creating responsive layouts, styling, and interactive elements using HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>All images and content used in this project are either placeholders or sourced from free-to-use platforms, and all copyrights for the images belong to their respective owners. The website has been designed as part of a personal project to highlight my web design capabilities.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the design!</p>
